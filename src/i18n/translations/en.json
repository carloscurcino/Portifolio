I started learning some python when I was about 14 years old, but I really fell in love when I started learn html, css and javascript, because things were more concrete, and I could get an immediate return on what I built, it was sensational to see that I could create amazing things. And then I decide to get into this world, and became a programmer and started the Computer Science Bachelor. Since this I'm passionate about building websites and everything about programming.",
